## Running

1. Download the [Insomnia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/idao-2022-bootcamp-insomnia) and create a `Data` folder as stated above.
2. Run `IDAO.ipynb` file.
3. The `.csv` file with probabilities of positive insomnia will be created based on the files you'll have in the `Data` folder. 

You can also free to use the pretrained solutions in the `models` folder in case you want to.
